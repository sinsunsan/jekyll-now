### My main project : Collaborative architecture design

My main project is to make architecture design a collaborative process. 
Empower architects and architecture lovers to design with the community, sharing elements of projects with their team or under open source licences with the community. 

I have been working on 3 projects to realize this goal : 

* From 2016 [Bricks, a web app to design together with BIM and Agile workflow](http://bricksapp.io)
* From 2014 [Openbricks, a platform to share and explore open elements of architecture](http://www.openbricks.io)
