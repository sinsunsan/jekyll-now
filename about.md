Hello, 

I am SÃ©bastien Lucas, a self taugh web developer. 
I am building web sites and applications using Angular as a front end and Node as the backend from 2014 to 2016

### My story with code

From 2010 to 2013, I used to code in php and using Drupal CMS. 
In 2011, I worked for Rue 89
I released my first client site in 2009.
I learn php and mysql for the first time in 2007.
In 2010 I studied photography and started to work both as an [architecture photographer](http://www.sebastienlucas.com) and as a developer.
From 2002 to 2006 I've worked in different architecture, landscape and urbanism studio. 
From 1994 to 2002, I've studied Architecture
In 1986, I developed my first software using a Amstrad CPC 6128. The purpose of the game was a plane launching missile on boats. The missile was an ASCII character.
