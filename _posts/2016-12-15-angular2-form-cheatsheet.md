Angular 2 form add many improvements on angular 1 version. There is good in [depth tutorials](http://dev.sebastienlucas.com/good-tutorials-to-learn-angular2/) explaining how to use it.

Let's list the most important elements to record for those who used angular forms in version 1.


### 2 ways to build forms : template driven and model driven

Template driven is the traditional way with html and angular directives.

* **Advantages**:
   * Feel more natural and readable
   * More customizable for use case not foreseen by the framework

* **Disadvantages**:
   * Many boilerplates code : code that is always the same in all forms and not specific to this specific form. Boilerplates code is error prone because you can always mistype... And when there is a change in a big site, hundreds of templates need to be changed.
   * Not testable with units tests (Only by E2E tests)

Model driven is with a form javascript API that angular 2 introduces in core. Where as in the version 1 only libraries were developing this concept.

* **Advantages**:
  * Very compact declarative style  form definition
  * Minimal boilerplates
  * Easy updates and config sharing among many forms
  * Testable with units tests

* **Disadvantages**:
  * You need to learn the API
  * May feel less understandable for people that do not know the API

### Template driven forms

* We need to import the form module to enable ngModel and form stuff

```ts
import {FormsModule} from "@angular/forms";
@NgModule({
    declarations: [App],
    imports: [BrowserModule, FormsModule],
    bootstrap: [App]
})
```

#### The Ng-model accept two-way or one-way binding

With angular 1 forms, we had the case that the changes in the form get reflected instantly in the rest of the page. As 2 way binding was the default. This could not be always intended. In angular 2, you have the choice :

* **[(ngModel)]="proj.field"** : to have the form state reflected back in real time (two way binding)
* **[ngModel]="proj.field"** : to have the form data just initialized and actualized programmatically when the form is submitted and when the api call is successful. (one way binding)
* **ngModel**: If you do not want initialization but form validation a simple  ngModel without any field or object

#### Syntax the name the form

To identify the form and be able to  access it's data (not the ng-model) but all data about form validation, touched, non touched states...
you use this syntax :

**#NameOfYouForm="ngForm"**

Yes it is strange!
But why not?

```html
<form #myForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="submit()">
```

You probably need to access it to prevent the form to be submitted.
**myForm.valid** is testing a global form bolean  that is true if all form fields are valid (required fields filled, no validation errors...)

```html
<button type="submit" [disabled]="!myForm.valid">Submit</button>
```

#### Form controls

Each field identified by a name is
````html
<input type="text" name="project">
````

And could be found in **myForm.forms.controls**.
