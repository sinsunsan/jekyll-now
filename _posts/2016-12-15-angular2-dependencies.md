title: Angular 2 external dependencies
---
Angular 2 is built on external dependencies.
That can be confusing at first but let's look at them closely as underneath the angular 2 framework, their will be at the commands. If there is a bug, their role need to be understood.

```js
"dependencies": {
    "core-js": "^2.4.1",
    "reflect-metadata": "^0.1.3",
    "rxjs": "5.0.0-rc.4",
    "zone.js": "^0.7.2"
  }
```

### Core-js

### Reflect Metadata

### Rxjs

### zone.js
