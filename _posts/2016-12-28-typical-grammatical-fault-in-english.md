title: The common errors I do writing english
---

As many developers I use english on a daily basis, but mostly to write and read.
I do not speak often with native english speakers. The problem is that when we write and we are not it an english speaking country, we can do the same errors again and again, without getting better.

I am french, and I also do many errors in french which is far more complicated to write correctly that english. Though english have its difficulties too.

I will do a list of my most common errors as I realize, to may be stop doing them.

Let's debug the language as efficiently we debug code :)


### There **is** lot of cats

There **is** lot of cats > There **are** lot of cats    
In french Il y a beaucoup de chats     
In french 'Il y a' is invariable so if we speak about cats it is always chats.     
In english There +  verb to be take the plural of what follow    

### He **do** a great job

He **do** a great job > He do**es** a great job    
Why?    
English have a simplistic conjugation by comparison with latin languages.
But there is one exception for he, she, it pronouns that make the verb take a s.

* I do
* You do
* He does
* We do
* You do
* They do   

do, do, do, does, do, do, do     
Simple suite, isn't it?

## Per aps > Perhaps

Strange word Perhaps? I wonder what is the origin.
Here are the synonyms suggested by google translate.

The 3 I use
* perhaps
* maybe > Peut-Ãªtre
* probably > Probablement

I do not use
* possibly
* supposedly
* perchance
