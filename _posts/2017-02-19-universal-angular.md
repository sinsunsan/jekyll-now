published: true

We have written a more [step by step tuto to start with angular universal starter](http://dev.sebastienlucas.com/how-to-use-the-angular-universal-starter/).

But let's start with an introduction of what it is.

Here is the best description of what angular universal is :

### The future of universal angular

Universal angular will be merged in angular v4 for the api part,the tools remaining  in angular universal library

The code will be integrated in platform-server.

 Follow this [issue](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/13822) to have updates.

## Why

* SEO Friendly
* Social  media friendly (link posted in facebook, twitter...)
* Faster for the end users

## How  it works

* The site is rendered entirely in the backend with the good state
* It records the events the user may have triggered (click, hover..., change menu... )
* When the front end is loaded (in an hidden div), the events are replayed from the info stored by the backend
* Then it handle the rest of the request...


### The angular universal repository

![The angular universal repository]({{site.baseurl}}/images/universal-directory.png)

In the modules directory of universal angular, we see different way to use the prerendering :

_Static prerendering using Gulp, grunt or webpack_
* **webpack-prerender** :
* **grunt-prerender** :
* **gulp-prerender**

_Render engines for node js server_
* **hapi-engine**
* **express-engine**

_Main modules_
* **universal** Main module
* **universal-polyfill** Polyfills
* **platform-node** in reference to platform-browser, [platform-server](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/modules/%40angular/platform-server) of angular core

## Unsolved questions

* How to deal with front router parameter in backend ?
`{ path: 'page/:pageId', component: pageComponent },`

* What to do with jquery library ? How jquery libs wrapper should be ? that touch the DOM ?


## What **not** to do in angular 2 to be universal loader compatible

* Not manipulate DOM directly nor with jquery
`document.domMethod() or $('dom-element')`
Instead use the following angular methods
    * [ElementRef](https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/api/core/index/ElementRef-class.html)
    * [Renderer](https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/api/core/index/Renderer-class.html)
    * [ViewContainerRef](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/index/ViewContainerRef-class.html)

## Libraries needed

* Template url and styles url need to be inlined and packed in the angular component :
> To use `templateUrl` or `styleUrls` you must use **`angular2-template-loader`** in your TS loaders.

If  you use inline css or html already this step is not necessary, but if you prefer like me writing css and html in a separate file, the content of the files need to be inline  by this  web pack plugin.

## How to test that the server rendering is correct ?

* See the source of the page : The source of the page is supposed to be the unmodified content retrieved from the server, whereas chrome debug explorer show the code produced from that by angular
* Disable javascript to have only the  server rendering :

This solution was proposed by [@MarkPieszak](https://github.com/angular/universal-starter/issues/372#issuecomment-281711218)
> One super easy way to test SSR is to go to your Chrome devtools, settings, and click the Disable JavaScript checkbox. Then try refreshing / clicking around your app. No client-side at all, everything came from the server! :)
