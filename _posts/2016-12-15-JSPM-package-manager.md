title: JSPM A good alternative to web pack
---
Jspm is an alternative to using webpack. It's philosophy is quite different and intersting. Here is what you need to know about it. 

### JSPM online 

The main site 
[http://jspm.io/](http://jspm.io/)

The [documentation of  jspm on github](https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/tree/master/docs)


### In short 

* JSPM use existing Package managers : NPM & Github 

* JSPM manage the config.js file to be used by system.js 

* JPSM store it's information is 2 places: the **package.json** and the **config.js** file 
The first one is used by NPM and allow to reproduce the exact JSPM installation 
The second is used by system.js and allow to the JS module  loader to do the mapping between named ```import  import * from { @angular }```
and the exact location of the file in the `jspm_packages`

### How JSPM deal with version 

jspm install installs the latest versions of packages listed in the package.json respecting semver ranges defined in it. 

Once installed, exact versions numbers(not ranges) are stored in jspm's config.js. The subsequent jspm installs will install concrete versions stored in the config.js

### version required by the app & versions required by the libs

JSPM install version required by the libraries also so it can store and import different versions

Let's inspect the rxjs  packages isntalled

```
jspm inspect npm:rxjs

Installed versions of npm:rxjs

       rxjs 5.0.1 (^5.0.1)

       npm:@angular/core@2.3.1
         rxjs 5.0.0-rc.4 (5.0.0-rc.4)

       npm:@angular/http@2.3.1
         rxjs 5.0.0-rc.4 (5.0.0-rc.4)

       npm:@angular/router@3.3.1
         rxjs 5.0.0-rc.4 (5.0.0-rc.4)

       npm:angularfire2@2.0.0-beta.6-preview
         rxjs 5.0.0-beta.12 (5.0.0-beta.12)

```

#### Download packages

`jspm update` Update libraries to their  latest version in the range defined in the package.json
`jspm inspect` List all exact version install by  jspm 
`jspm install` Reinstall all libraries following package.js stored jspm formula
