More a cheatsheet for my webstorm usage or when I need to install it again.

* Tslint  : enable and choose a configuration file 
* Typescript : disable typescript compiler
* Disable typo: editor > inspections > spelling > typo
* Set ident to 2: editor > code style > typescript (and javascript, pug..) > and set ident to 2 save in the IDE and in the project
