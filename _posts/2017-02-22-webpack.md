#### Reading the doc

One of the worst aspect of web pack is its doc.
I do not know exactly why but reading it and grasping the main concept is slow and painful.

Any way here are some starting page you can try your self :

* **using webpack for css**

[https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting-css](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting-css/)

#### Cannot read property 'hash' of undefined

````
95% emittingFatal error: Cannot read property 'hash' of undefined
````

In my case was due to a missing loader in package.json ts-loader that was required in the web pack config file.

### Some settings I use

My sass rule :

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sinsunsan/efc62202cd7ab9183df70908e6fab97b.js"></script>

### Useful webpack plugin
