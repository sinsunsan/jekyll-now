### One repo or multiple repos

* One repo better https://nrwl.io/nx/why-a-workspace

* One or multiple in the context  of micro-services

### What is Continuous integration / Continuous deployement

Continuous Integration (CI) : Push changes on developement server quickly and automatically so new changes can be tested earlier 

Continous Deployement (CD) : Push changes on production server quickly and automatically so new changes can benefits to users earlier

The most important being : 

The practice

* Maintain a single source repository
* Automate the build
* Make your build self-testing
* Every commit should build on an integration machine
* Keep the build fast
* Test in a clone of the production environment
* Make it easy for anyone to get the latest executable version
* Everyone can see what’s happening 
* Automate deployment


How to do it 

* Developers check out code into their private workspaces
* When done, commit the changes to the repository
* The CI server monitors the repository and checks out changes when they occur
* The CI server builds the system and runs unit and integration tests
* The CI server releases deployable artefacts for testing
* The CI server assigns a build label to the version of the code it just built
* The CI server informs the team of the successful build
* If the build or tests fail, the CI server alerts the team
* The team fixes the issue at the earliest opportunity
* Continue to continually integrate and test throughout the project

Team responsibilities

* Check in frequently
* Don’t check in broken code
* Don’t check in untested code
* Don’t check in when the build is broken
* Don’t go home after checking in until the system builds
