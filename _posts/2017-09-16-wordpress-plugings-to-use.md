I was not a big fan of wordpress, as I started in 2010 with Drupal another CMS. Drupal  is more complicated than worprss and also more integrated : modules work really together. Drupal has a true free and open source model. In wordpress, there is often a premium  model with plugins that are free, but that have a premium version that do have a price. Both CMS have the problem of a cluttered UI due to the many possibilities that each plugins / modules can take profit to add its settings.

Anyway despite of it's drawbacks, Wordpress is quite useful and generally I start with a theme I've bough and then customize it. 
There is a bunch of plugins that I need to install. 

So let's start a list to go faster when installing a new site.
