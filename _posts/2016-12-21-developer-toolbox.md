Developer tooling is important!   
With good tools we lose less time in stupid things and can concentrate on the app specific stuff we are paid (or not paid) for.

## A text editor

* Sublime text
* Atom.io

### A browser with  good debugging

Alternatives are :

* Chrome With dev tools
* Mozilla Firefox with debugger
* Chrome canary with dev tools

Though Firefox have interesting features with a nice design of the debugger. Chrome offer more extensions and mainly I am  more used to chrome for good or bad reasons.

### Online coding

Allow to test code online before puting in your project
* [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com)
* Js bin
* Plunkr
* Code edit
* ...

## A terminal

* iterm better terminal for Mac https://www.iterm2.com/
* A well though shell settings maintained by community

## A simple node server 

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server

## Versioning

* git
* github account

## Misc

* Ngrok [https://ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) allow to make localhost available on www to share an url to others or test situations where a distant server need to access your machine (web hook for example).


tuneling an app with a specific port to make it available on a mobile phone for example 
```ngrok http --host-header=rewrite 4200```


The following screen is what we see when we launch a port tunneling with ngrok.

```
/Applications/ngrok http 8001
```

The official description is :
> ngrok exposes local networked services behinds NATs and firewalls to the
  public internet over a secure tunnel. Share local websites, build/test
  webhook consumers and self-host personal services.

* App cleaner     
[https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/)

When chrome get mad with its settings for example the famous dev tools zoom that you are unable to reset. Just reinstall Chrome. But in order to delete properly and do get rid of the settings that annoy, this simple free app will do the job. Select the app(s) you want to truly delete and click on the search button to launch to search for dependency files, they click on delete.
