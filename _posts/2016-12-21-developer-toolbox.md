Developer tooling is important!   
With good tools we lose less time in stupid things and can concentrate on the app specific stuff we are paid (or not paid) for. 

## A text editor

* Sublime text
* Atom.io

## A terminal

* iterm better terminal for Mac

## Versioning

* git
* github account

## Misc

* Ngrok [https://ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) allow to make localhost available on www to share an url to others or test situations where a distant server need to access your machine (web hook for example).

The following screen is what we see when we launch a port tunneling with ngrok.

```
/Applications/ngrok http 8001
```

The official description is :
> ngrok exposes local networked services behinds NATs and firewalls to the
  public internet over a secure tunnel. Share local websites, build/test
  webhook consumers and self-host personal services.
