title: Understanding mysterious google cloud authentication
---

Authentication is the more frustrating part of google cloud at first.
It seems really complicated with various system, a terminology that at first we do not understand.

Let's list a few facts, we have understood.

## Enabling the API's and discovering API manager

* Accessing  the api guide [https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/accessing-the-api](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/accessing-the-api)

the tutorial suggest you
> Enable both the Google App Engine Admin API and Google Cloud Storage API in your Cloud Platform project:

So :

* Api's are not enabled by default
* there is 2 concepts :
   * google cloud storage : for storing static files
   * google app engine : to compute app like a virtual machine

When clicking on the enable [all apis  button](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=appengine,storage_component)

I notice a panel that is about APIS

![API panel]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gcloud-api-panel.png)

That go to a page dedicated to all APIs. Not only the 2 mentioned, but more APIS that are in those 2 groups of APIS- storage and compute.

![Google cloud APIS]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gcloud-api.png)

This page is also accessible via a side menu.

![Gcloud side menu]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gcloud-side-menu.png)

Once in the APIs Manager page, you have a credentials menu item.

![Credentials gcloud]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gcloud-credential-wizard.png)

The last item of this menu offer to help choose. Good idea!

You can access this wizard directly at this [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/wizard).


## What type of authentication?

There is 3 types :

* API keys : A simple  API key. Some were already generated by the browser or the server (per aps by firebase) in my case.
* OAuth 2.0 client IDs : A way to create an account on you site thanks to their google login (for your app users)
* Service account keys : A variant or API keys?

## What is Application Default Credentials?

For the case of a server that want to have access to the app.
I ended with the concept of **Application Default Credentials**.
Documented in this [page](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials?hl=en_US).

I am interested in the [node.js version](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials#callingnode)

It use a library :   
[https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client](https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client) which is global to all google APIs.

> Google's officially supported Node.js client library for accessing Google APIs. Support for authorization and authentication with OAuth 2.0, API Keys and JWT (Service Tokens) is included

So let's install it :

`npm install googleapis --save`

Another place to look at is this page

[https://developers.google.com/identity/](https://developers.google.com/identity/)

Which is the identification temple of google!
All google methods to authenticate.

Among which this mysterious **Application Default Credentials**.

After reading a bit, it seems there is another node.js more specific library only for google authentication.

Let's use it, as its doc should be clearer (as it is more specific)

> This is Google's officially supported node.js client library for using OAuth 2.0 authorization and authentication with Google APIs.

[https://github.com/google/google-auth-library-nodejs](https://github.com/google/google-auth-library-nodejs)

So again :

`npm install google-auth-library --save`

## The google-cloud-node library the library to use

While reading a [discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/firebase-talk/13kBF0PpmQA) on how to use google storage instead of firebase (which does not have a SDK yet in node.js)
[https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-node](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-node)

So let's sum up :

* [https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client](https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client) Manage all google apis with node.js app independently of gcloud
* [https://github.com/google/google-auth-library-nodejs](https://github.com/google/google-auth-library-nodejs) Manage only the authentication in the  context of gcloud or not
* [https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-node](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-node) the gcloud specific library

The response of Aurelien is quite interesting

Yes I found the source!

Google cloud
> google-cloud is a client library for accessing Google Cloud Platform services that significantly reduces the boilerplate code you have to write.

Yes, I do not like writing boiler plate code! After hours of search I am quite happy to see this promise of simplicity.

![Google cloud]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gcloud-client-header.png)
[https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-node/#/]( https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-node/#/)

And google cloud is the recommended way, good to know....

> The Google APIs Node.js Client is a client library for using the broad set of Google APIs. google-cloud is built specifically for the Google Cloud Platform and is the recommended way to integrate Google Cloud APIs into your Node.js applications. If your application requires both Google Cloud Platform and other Google APIs, the 2 libraries may be used by your application.


### google-cloud-node do not take my json  key

Here is a much more detailed description on how to authenticate with google-cloud SDK (not be mistaken with gcloud the command line utility)
[https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-node/#/docs/google-cloud/0.45.0/guides/authentication](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-node/#/docs/google-cloud/0.45.0/guides/authentication)

Then I set my authentication in my node.js file.

```
var gcloud = require('gcloud')({
  // the project Id is the unique id of the project
  // derived from the project name
  // it looks like myproject-1d298
  projectId: 'myProject-Name',
  keyFileName: './bamarchi-42fde040ae9d.json',
});
```

The **keyfileName** is the path to the service account key you have created in the google cloud console at [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials]( https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)

![Google cloud]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gcloud-service-account.png)

And relaunched my API using those settings.
But was stopped by an other error.

```
firebase there was an error uploading to gcloud Error: Could not load the default credentials. Browse to https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/application-default-credent
```

I then investigated the code that triggered this error, and found that the code is checking if the code is executed from a google cloud Engine (GCE) or not.

So if it is not the case (I am in local), it triggered this error independently of if it found the famous service key or not.

By reading again this the page linked  in the error [https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials)

###  Application Default credential need to be set in an env variable!

I figured that to set the application default credentials, we need to modify an environment variable.     
What is a environment variable?      
They are UNIX variables that you can set in the command line by typing `export`.

```
export nameOftheVariable="valueOfTheVariable"
```

To get a list of variable already defined in your machine.    

Just type :

```
export
```

You will be surprised to find :

* PATH The list of directory where are placed some executables
* PWD the current directory
* ....

and lot of basic settings very important everywhere :)

So let's set application default credentials as mentioned in the doc :

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/the/myproject-key.json"
```

### Credentials fixed / What's next ?

The last  export  command seemed to have solved the credential missing error.
I understood also that only the environmental is necessary,
or at least only that is sucessfull to authenticate.
But my google cloud quest is not finished!

Here is the next error message.
What is not found ?
The api route used by gcloud bucket.upload function?
Or the file I am giving it to upload?
By the way what is the file format it is expecting?
```

```

Let's read in the file it self where is that function Bucket.upload
It's [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-node/blob/master/packages/storage/src/bucket.js).

The comments are quite informative and give link to a online documentation.
This page is the documentation on [Gcloud storage upload module](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/how-tos/upload).

There are 3 types of upload :

* **simple** : only a file
* **multi-part** : a file + its metadata
* **resumable** : that can resume if a network disconnection occurred (for large file)
